# SUPER MEGA ULTRA ERGO KEYBOARD 

This is another mechanical, 3d-printable dome-shaped keyboard.
It was written in clojure from scratch using the great DSL scad-clj.

## Usage
In the last section of the sourcefile are commands to create openScad files.
Those files can be used to create stl-files for 3D-printing.
